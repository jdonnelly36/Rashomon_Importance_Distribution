## RID Documentation
This codebase contains the code necessary to compute the Rashomon Importance Distribution as described in "The Rashomon Importance Distribution: Getting RID of Unstable, Single Model-Based Variable Importance". 

### Environment Setup
In order to configure your environment, you will need to:
1. Install all required python packages via `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Computing RID
A simple demonstration of the RID interface can be seen in `example.ipynb`. The primary interface for RID is the `RashomonImportanceDistribution` class, which computes RID in its constructor and provides functions to examine RID.
